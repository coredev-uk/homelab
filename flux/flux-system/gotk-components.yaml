# This file should be generated using:
# flux install --export > flux/flux-system/gotk-components.yaml
#
# For now, this is a placeholder. To generate the actual Flux components:
# 1. Install flux CLI: brew install fluxcd/tap/flux
# 2. Run: flux install --export > flux/flux-system/gotk-components.yaml
#
# This will generate all Flux controllers (source-controller, kustomize-controller, 
# helm-controller, notification-controller) as Kubernetes manifests.
#
# Note: We keep this as a separate file to track Flux version explicitly.
